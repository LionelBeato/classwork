## Labs 

### Quick CSS Lab

1. Create a website project (remember the three main files that we have to make!).
2. In our CSS, style an element with a unique property. I recommend trying border-radius on an image.
3. Push it to github! 


### Heroku

1. Sign up for Heroku
2. Install the Heroku CLI tool (link down below!)


### Fullfledged Website


1. Make a wireframe for a website. Create that website (remember than you can reuse your code from previous efforts).
2. Have 5 different CSS Selectors with at least one having 3 different properties. 
3. Play around with any of the tech we learned today, I suggest embedding a youtube video that you like. 
4. Push it to github and host it through github pages! 

## Homework

### React homework! (Optional)

1. Lets try out React! Use npx create-react-app to start off. 
2. Make a new component that shows your name and add some text about yourself.
3. Push it to github.
