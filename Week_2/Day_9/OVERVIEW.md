# Febuary 6, 2020 - Day 9

## Agenda

- Review GitHub and best practices for git.
- What does it mean to hit a milestone? 
- Do we like git? Do we like GitHub? Why or why not?
- Review branching and why you would need it. 
- What are some alternatives? Are they viable? 
- Review Readmes again and show a good example of a readme. 
- Look into CI/CD and see how it can optimize our workflow. 


Best Practices for git:

- Naming best practices: lowercase, try to avoid underscores

my_git => my-git => mygit

- Issue: basically a problem that you can open on your github. Issues can be assigned and closed. 

#4342-bug-navbar => this naming convention can be applied to *bugs*, *features*, and *hotfixes*.

- What is a release candidate? RC-01.2.3. Basically code that your development team is okay wih shipping. 

- What is testing/development branch? Code that you're actively working on.

- How do I write version numbers? What does this mean? => 0.0.1? Version 1.0 usually means version 1.0.0.! From right to left, the first digit is for hotfixes and bugs and feature development. Second is for major milestones and commits/complete features. Last digit is for release candidates and major revisions. Examples: 

2.323.32
1.999.93
