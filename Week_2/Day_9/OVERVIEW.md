# Febuary 6, 2020 - Day 9

## Agenda

- Review GitHub and best practices for git.
- What does it mean to hit a milestone? 
- Do we like git? Do we like GitHub? Why or why not?
- Review branching and why you would need it. 
- What are some alternatives? Are they viable? 
- Review Readmes again and show a good example of a readme. 
- Look into CI/CD and see how it can optimize our workflow. 


Best Practices for git:

- Naming best practices: lowercase, try to avoid underscores

my_git => my-git => mygit

- Issue: basically a problem that you can open on your github. Issues can be assigned and closed. 

#4342-bug-navbar => this naming convention can be applied to *bugs*, *features*, and *hotfixes*.

- What is a release candidate? RC-01.2.3. Basically code that your development team is okay wih shipping. 

- What is testing/development branch? Code that you're actively working on.

- How do I write version numbers? What does this mean? => 0.0.1? Version 1.0 usually means version 1.0.0.! From right to left, the first digit is for hotfixes and bugs and feature development. Second is for major milestones and commits/complete features. Last digit is for release candidates and major revisions. Examples: 

2.323.32
1.999.93

## Lab

### Git Practice

1. In your website repository, make a new branch and work on that branch exclusively.
2. Write a descriptive readme.
3. Push that branch to github.
4. Open a pull request and pull any changes into master.

### Website

1. Continue working on your website! Create a new branch that will correspond to a new *feature* on your website. Remember to name it something that makes sense. 
2. Work on your branch and push it to GitHub. 
3. (Optional) Add me as a collaborator. 
4. (Super Optional) Add some javascript to your website!

## Homework 

### Collaborate on the Classwork Repo

1. Accept my invite to collaborate on my classwork repo.
2. Create a branch with a unique name that corresponds to a website feature (so navbar/list/etc).
3. Work on that feature on that branch (in the homework folder) and push it to GitHub.
4. Open a pull request and wait for me to approve it!
