### Try and Catch

1. In your script file, create a try and catch block with a function inside of it that hasn't been declared. 
2. Create a custom error messsage that explains why there was an error.
3. Add a try and catch code block to your website for the week! 
4. (Optional) Throw a custom error in your try catch block! 

```javascript
try {
    // this function doesn't exist, so it should throw an error
     myFunc()
} catch (error) {
    // resolves with a console.log()
    console.log(`You just got an error! ${error}`)
}
```

### Accessibility Lab

1. Go back to your website and try to make it accessible. Remember color contrast and text size.
2. Run some tools on your website in order to test it! 
3. Push it to github.
4. (Optional but encouraged) Host it on GitHub Pages.
