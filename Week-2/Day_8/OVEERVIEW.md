## Labs 

### Variables and  Pseudo-selectors

1. On your website, ***refactor*** all of the CSS so that you use variables instead of repeating yourself (this is ideal if you used a color pallete!).

2. Add in at least two psuedo-classes and two psuedo-elements, so four psuedo-selectors in total.

3. (Optional) Create one element that "pops up" when you hover over it. You would need to use drop shadow and, if you'd like, positioning. 

4. (Super Optional) Look up how to animate it and add it to your code!

5. Push it to GitHub. 

## Homework

### (Optional) Sass Experimentation

1. Create a simple text based website to work with. Use npm init.
2. Install Sass to that project.
3. Experiment with declaring different variables. See if you like one CSS implementation over another. Is one faster or cleaner? Why or why not? Maybe write down how you feel about Sass on your website. 
4. Push it to GitHub! 

### (Super Optional) Sass Implementation

1. Take your website from the lab and implement Sass into it. Remember that you might have to convert into a node project. 
2. Push your changes to GitHub!
