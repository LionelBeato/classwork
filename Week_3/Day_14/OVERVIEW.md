## Lab

### Play around with DOM methods

1. Target a specific node on your index.html via a DOM method.
2. Make a change in your document (you can use innerHTML, for example)
3. Play around with a window method (remember that in global scope "this" refers to window)
4. Set something in your current memory using local storage.
5. Finally, add an event listener to your script.js.
6. Push your lab to github! 



### Continue working on your application

1. Make sure you have a working get method and at least one additional method (I recommend post).
2. Continue building out your site with semantically coherent elements. Have at least a navbar, main, and a footer. 
3. Add at least one event listener on your website. It can simply output to the console if you want!
4. Push Everything to github. 


## Homework
