## Lab

### Play around with DOM methods

1. Target a specific node on your index.html via a DOM method.
2. Make a change in your document (you can use innerHTML, for example)
3. Play around with a window method (remember that in global scope "this" refers to window)
4. Finally, set something in your current memory using local storage. 

### Simple TODO List


### Set up MongoDB


### Continue working on your application

1. Make sure you have a working get method and at least one additional method (I recommend post).
2. Continue building out your site with semantically coherent elements. Have at least a navbar, main, and a footer. 
3. Push everything to github.

## Homework

### Hook up your hyperlinks


## Links 

### Good example of web storage
