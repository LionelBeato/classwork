## Lab

### Make Codepen Account and JQuery

1. Make a codepen account and start a new pen
2. Make sure you import JQuery under javascript settings
3. Play around with DOM manipulations and save your pen, here are some templates for you to try:

```JQuery

$("<selector goes here>").hide()
$("<selector goes here>").text("<content goes here>")
```

### React!

1. Create a react app using npx create-react-app.
2. Add in at least two additional components.
3. Have one component render text via a template literal.
4. Have a component with a prop that you define as an attribute.
5. Have a component with state (the count example, for instance)
6. Push this project to github
