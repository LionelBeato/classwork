## Lab

### Continue working on your apps

1. Continue working on your backends and frontends. Think about a simple model you may want to render and implement. FOr my project, I will create a simple blog. 

2. Make sure that your frontend is consuming your backend's heroku URL. 

3. Refine the appearance and styling of your frontend. Create the basic building blocks of a website for the page that will render your content:

    - navbar
    - main 
    - footer 

4. Consider making your rendered content a component that accepts props. This will allow you to have more flexible content in your frontend.
