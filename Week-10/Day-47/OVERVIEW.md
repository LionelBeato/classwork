## Lab

### Heroku Deployment

1. Though you can build your project using `gradlew build` and upload the `.jar`, it's actually simpler to go to your project root and write `heroku create` in a terminal. 

2. Once you've done that, you can simply type `git push heroku master` to push to your heroku remote. Heroku will detect your spring app and build it using gradle! 

3. If you attempt to open your page in chrome, you'll more than likely get a *whitelabel error*. If you want to test out your api, plug in the URL of your heroku app into postman and test it out that way. Remember to add `/graphql` at the end of the URL.
