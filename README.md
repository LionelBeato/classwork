# Index 

## A

- *abstract/abstract class* : in Java, a class implementation that must be overridden if extended. Abstract code has no direct implementation when declared. 

- *absraction* : the concept that code implementation should be hidden or obfuscated. 

## B

- *best practice(s)* : an established way of doing things. 

- *byte code* : compact, portable code that can be compiled into machine-code. 

## C

- *class* : a discrete grouping of data that can be instatiated. 

- *code smell* : something that indicates poorly written code.

- *compiling* : to convert source code into machine-code or byte code. 

## D

- *design pattern* : a reusable solution or methodology that addresses a specific problem. 

- *dark pattern* : a design pattern that is typically user-agressive or exploitative. 

## E

- *encapsulation* : the concept that code can be wrapped or contained by other code for safety and security purposes. 

## F

- *flavor* : a specific version of a technology stack that has unique implementation. For instance, mySQL is a *flavor* of SQL.

## I

- *inheritance* : the concept that objects can have properties that stem from parent objects; "the child can do everything the parent can, plus more." 

- *interface* : a class that does not have implementation and which other classes can implement.

## M

- *machine code* : a set of instructions that can be easily understood by a CPU. 

- *middleware* : code that is packaged and used as boilerplate for your application. 

## O

- *object* : a variable that may represent data/values in whatever structure. In class-based languages, an object refers to an *instance* of that class. 

## P

- *portability* : in regards to software, the ability to run on many different kinds of computers without augmentation.

- *polymorphism* : the concept that objects can behave like other objects, or more succinctly: "“same name, different logic”. 

- *primitive* : a data type that is typically a basic building block of a language and denotes a value.

- *push*, *pushing* : to sync code with a remote repository.

## R

- *refactor* : to change code for the better. 

- *reference* : a value that represents an indirectly accessed piece of data, or 'datum'. 

- *repository* : in reference to git, a collection of files representing a project, typically composed of source code.

## S

- *source code* : the human readable, programmed code for an application. 

## T

- *type casting* : to assign the value of one primitive to another. 

## #4 

- *The 4 Pillars of OOP* : The major concepts and design patterns that are the backbone for object-oriented programming. The 4 Pillars are as followed:
    1. *Abstraction*
    2. *Encapsulation*
    3. *Inheritance*
    4. *Polymorphism*
