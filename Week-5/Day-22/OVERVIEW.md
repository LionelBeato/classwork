## Lab


### Class Practice

1. Create a new Java Project using gradle.
2. In your project, create a `User` class, a `Product` class, and a `Pet` class. What should each class have as methods and fields? Think about it logically. 
3. In ur `Pryooduct` class, create a field and methods that handle quantity. 
4. In your `Pet` class, create a method that returns the pet's cry (bark, meow, etc).
5. Create a `Vehicle` class and figure out the implementation. What does a vehicle have? What does it do? 


## Homework

### Array Practice 

1. Create a `Student` class that extends `Person` and describe relevant fields and methods. 
2. In your main class, create an array of type `Student`.
3. Construct at least three students and using `.add()`, add them to the list. 
4. Using `.stream()` and `.map()` and `.forEach`, for each student in your student array, `System.out::println` the element. 

### Spring Boot App 

1. Make a Spring Boot application! We will be working on this for the rest of the week!
2. Create a controller class and map `/hello` to a function that returns a string.
3. Under `resources/static/` create an index.html, style.css, script.js.
4. Fill your index.html with the basic building blocks of your website and link it to your css and js. 
5. Push what you have to GitHub!
