## Lab


### Class Practice

1. Create a new Java Project using gradle.
2. In your project, create a `User` class, a `Product` class, and a `Pet` class. What should each class have as methods and fields? Think about it logically. 
3. In your `Product` class, create a field and methods that handle quantity. 
4. In your `Pet` class, create a method that returns the pet's cry (bark, meow, etc).
5. Create a `Vehicle` class and figure out the implementation. What does a vehicle have? What does it do? 

### Array Practice 

1. Create a `Student` class that extends `Person` and describe relevant fields and methods. 
2. In your main class, create an array of type `Student`.
3. Construct at least three students and using `.add()`, add them to the list. 
4. Using `.stream()` and `.map()` and `.forEach`, for each student in your student array, `System.out::println` the element.
