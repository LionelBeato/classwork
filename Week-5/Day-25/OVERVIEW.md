# February 28, 2019 - Day 25


## Agenda

- Finally, functional programming in Java!
- Explore *lambdas* and *streams* and how we can utilize them in our code. 
- Dive into the history of *lambda calculus*. 

- Find out what *service* is and what it represents. 
- Review seperation of concerns. 
- Explore hosting options for our Java app.
- Package our Java app into a Jar.

## Lab

### Lambda Practice

1. In your project, I want you to create an functional interface. Remember that functional interfaces can only have one method. 

2. Create a new instance of your functional interface and write it out as a lambda expression. 

3. Use that lambda expression to print something to the console. 

### Streams Practice

1. In your project, create an ArrayList that takes Integers as elements. Have at least 10 elements. 
2. Using higher order functions and streams, I want you to manipulate every element in the array so that for each element you get back the element plus 5. 
3. Within your stream, print the elements of the stream to your console.
4. Using either another stream or opening the original one again, reduce the elements of the stream in some fashion.
