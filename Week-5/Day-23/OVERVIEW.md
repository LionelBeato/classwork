## Lab

### Interface Practice

1. Create three different classes that are logically children of one super class. 
2. Create an interface that can logically be implemented by those children classes. 
3. Describe the implementation for that interface.

## Homework

### Abstract Classes

1. Create a super *abstract* class and at least two children of that super class. 
2. In your super class, write one method that will be inherited by its children.
3. Note that the IDE should be indicating that there's an error. Fix it by overriding the abstract method from the super class using `@override`.
4. When you override, be sure to have the implementation make sense. 

### Create your MVC!

1. In your Spring project, create a model and a repo(DAO -- Data Access Object) for that model. 
2. In your controller, have a get method that will return all of the items in your repository. 
3. Implement a runner that will save items into your repository.
