## Lab

### Simple Format Challenge

1. In your Java app. Declare a value for a noun, an adjective, and a verb. Prompt the user for those values using `scanner`. 
2. Output those values in a sentence using `System.out.println`. 

### If/Else Challenge

1. Using classes, create two different instances of two different classes (so a dog class and a cat class, for example). Have a method that prints something to your console in those classes.

2. Check to see the instance of your object with a if loop and the `instanceof` keyword. Inside your if your block, call the method belonging to your class. 

### Guessing Game

1. Using `Scanner`, ask the user for a number between 1 and 100.
2. Create a random number variable that is from a range of 1 to 100. 
3. If the number is exactly the user input, have the program acknowledge this. 
4. If the number is too low or too high, have the program acknowledge this as well. 
5. If the number is within 5 digits, have the program output "so close!" or something to that effect.
