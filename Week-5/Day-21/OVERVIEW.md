## Lab

### Simple Format Challenge

1. In your Java app. Declare a value for a noun, an adjective, and a verb. Prompt the user for those values using `scanner`. 
2. Output those values in a sentence using `System.out.println`. 

### If/Else Challenge

1. Using classes, create two different instances of two different classes (so a dog class and a cat class, for example). Have a method that prints something to your console in those classes.

2. Check to see the instance of your object with a if loop and the `instanceof` keyword. Inside your if your block, call the method belonging to your class.
