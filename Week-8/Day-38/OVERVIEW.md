### Complete SQL Assignment from the day prior

2. If you have time, practice SQL commands with your own data from mockaroo. 

### Work on Gatsby

1. Keep refining and finetuning your Gatsby frontend.
2. If you want to look into how to integrate your backend, look at [this page on the Gatsby documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/third-party-graphql/)! We'll cover this in class tomorrow. 

## Homework

### SQL Practice

1. Review the slides example and follow it.
2. Create a new table called `albums` and reference that table in your `songs` table.
