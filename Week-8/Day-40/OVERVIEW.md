## Lab

### Java Assessment Review

1. Review anything on Java you feel that you need to. 
2. Be sure to ask me any questions at all! 


## Homework

1. Using your MariaDB database, practice subselects. 
2. Once you're done with that, create a custom view for your database. You can use any legal transaction for a view.
