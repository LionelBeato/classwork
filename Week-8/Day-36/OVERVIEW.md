## Lab

### Create your own Model for the GraphQL Project

1. In your project, create a new model for your graphQL. 
2. Create all of the necessary code in your DataFetcher and your Provider. 
3. Be sure to write your query in your Schema. 
4. Using postman and a `POST` method, be sure to test your API with a query.

## Homework

### SQL Practice

1. Install a version of SQL (MariaDB comes recommended).
2. Be sure to install a GUI for your database (tableplus).
3. Refer to the homework on Titus for further instructions. 
4. Create a small csv test data file with mockaroo and use it in your database. 
5. Try to create a custom record using `INSERT`.
6. Try to to delete a record using `DROP`. 
7. (Optional) If you can, Connect MariaDB to your GraphQL project. You would need to add in the necessary dependency and change your `application.properties`.
