## Lab

### Midterm Exam

- Using the link provided to you in your email, complete the google form exam.
- The exam will be split into three sections covering HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Java. 
- Each section will have 10 questions. 
- You may use your editor to troubleshoot and test code, but you may not look online to reference answers. 
- You may use your notes.
- We will review the exam together afterwards. 

### Java Exceptions

1. Create a program that works like a bank account. First you'll create your own exception that will be thrown when there's insufficient funds. 

2. Afterwards, create methods for handling deposit, withdraw, etc . 

3. Then augment your method to throw an exception if the condition is met. 

## Homework

### Create a Front-End!

1. Create a frontend using react that will dynamically render data from a springboot backend--I will be using GraphQL for this project and highly recommend that you do as well. 
2. Set up your project's styling and have all the essential components mapped out for the week.
