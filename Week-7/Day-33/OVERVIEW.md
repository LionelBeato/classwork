### Design Pattern Practice

1. Review the slides and lab and look at all the examples. Make sure you understand the implementation of these patterns. 
2. If you can, try to create a singleton of your choice, a factory of your choice, and implement the decorator pattern.


## Homework

### Keep Working on your App

1. Keep Working on your frontend and setup your backend as a Spring Boot app. 
2. Be sure to have picked your model by now. 
3. If there's time, implement graphQL into your backend.
