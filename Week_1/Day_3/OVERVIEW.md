## Labs 

### Java

1. Create a package in Intellij with simple command line boilerplate.
2. Customize the command line to say something you'd like. 
3. Create a new Class
4. Create methods in your new class
5. Reference that class in main


### Bootstrap

1. Make a site using Bootstrap! I encourage the use of VS Code with the bootstrap extension. 
2. Make sure you have three rows, and at least two columns. Remember margins and padding (bootstrap classes:m-1,p-1)
3. Make a repo on GitHub and push your project there! 

## Homework

1. (Optional) Create a repo for your Java project and push it there. 
2. (Super Optional) console.log() on your bootstrap page.
3. (Super Duper Optional) Look into writing an alert function and call it on a button.
