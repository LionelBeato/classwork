## Labs 

### Java OOP Practice 

1. Make two new classes where one is a superset of the other. Think animal to cat, aircraft to plane, etc. 
2. Override a method in a child class and make it do something different (you can return a string, for example).

### Agile Development

1. Create a trello account and make a board for this class with tasks and issues you want to track.
2. Create a Jira account. 
3. For the OOP Practice example, push it to github and create a github project for it. 
4. Create at least two issues on it and work on those issues in your code. 
5. Push everything and you're done for the day! 

## Homework

### (Optional, but strongly suggested) Review and Catchup 

1. Review all of the work you did.
2. Catch up on any labs or homework you didn't do.
3. Push them to github.
