## Labs

### HTML

1. Create an html file with a header, nav, and footer. Remember to use div tags. If you want, you can expand on yesterday's project.
2. Create a p element and incorporate span. Give your span some sort of styling. 
3. Style your elements however you like! Try to get elements centered and blocked out. 

### git

1. Take your project from today (or yesterday) and make it a git repository. 
2. Create a remote on github and link your repositories. 
3. (Optional) Play around with branching. See if you can make a "testing" branch. 
4. (Super Optional) Merge your testing branch into master.
