# January 30, 2020 - Day 4

## Agenda

- Get more in depth with JavaScript. Explore JQuery and arithmetic. If there's time, go over Node. 

## Outline

- 8:10AM-9:30AM Slides 
- 9:30AM-9:40AM Break
- 9:40AM-9:50AM Slides
- 9:50AM-12:00PM Assignment
- 12:00PM-1:00PM Lunch (I will take my lunch at 1:00PM and be back at 1:30PM)
- 1:00PM-3:30PM Lab time (I might show a quick video here)
- 3:30PM-5:00PM Office Hours 

## Labs 

### Math

1. In your script file, create a function that converts inches to centimeters. console.log the result. 

2. Remember that 1 inch is equal to 2.54 centimeters 
3. See if you can make your program dynamic but allowing you to plug in whatever value that you want.

### Conditional statement

1. stores the number of cups (that a person has consumed) in a variable
2. if the person has had less than 3 cups log a message to the console saying: ("Yes I'll take another cup of coffee")
3. if not log a message to console saying ("I think I'm okay for now")

### 99 Bottles of Beer Challenge

1. Write a simple version of "99 bottles of beer on the wall"
(note: make sure youre logging the result to the console)
2. Once you get the program running, log "Hey! We need more beer!" to the console when your counter hits 0
 
## Homework

### (Optional) Rock Paper Scissors

1. Create a simple rock paper scissors game in Javascript. I recommend using node. 
2. It can be only one round if that makes it easier for you. Remember that you need to compare different hands and give a result accordingly(console.log).
