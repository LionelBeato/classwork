## Lab

### Improve the Look and Feel of your Frontend

1. Ask yourself this: what are the major components that are most common on websites and how are they implemented visually? Try to replicate one of your favorite site's design philosophy and practices. 

2. Ensure that your website is *responsive* meaning it will change its layout and look visually coherent on most viewports. 

3. Keep improving your website incrementally. Be sure to refactor any inline styling and create as many components as possible for your site. Try not to repeat yourself while coding and if possible, try to reuse code.
