## Lab

### Finishing Touches on your Gatsby frontends

- Start wrapping up your Gatsby projects for the week. If you feel like you didn't finish it, don't be discouraged! Take the weekend to refine it further and keep working on it after that. These projects usually take a fair amount of time to get to a state where we're happy with them. It's up to you to now know when to finish it! 

### Continue Working on your Portfolio

- Continue working on your portfolio! Make it as nice and presentable as you can. Remember that your personal/portfolio site should always be evolving and in a constant state of iteration. Try to show off as many skills as you can! 

## Homework

### Explore Kotlin 

1. Very briefly, let's explore Kotlin. Kotlin support is built into Intellij, so there's nothing you need to download and zero configuration. 

2. Practice declaring variables. Declare a `var`, `val`, and `const val`. 

3. Practice writing some functions that accept some variables as arguments (parameters).

4. Write a main method that will call your functions. 

5. Push it to GitHub!
