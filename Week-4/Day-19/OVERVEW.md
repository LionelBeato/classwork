## Lab

### Our First Angular App! 

1. Create an angular app using `ng new <app-name>`
2. Open it up in VS Code and look at the project structure. Notice how components are grouped in their own folders. 
3. Try serving it by typing `ng serve --open`
4. In your project's root folder, make one new component using `ng generate component <component-name>` or `ng g c <component-name>` for short.
5. Delete everything in your app.component.html, and link your new component to it. 
6. Style the text in your component with the css file. 
7. Push your project to GitHub.  

## Homework

### Create a Simple, Complete Site

1. In your Angular app, I want you to think of your major website components and generate them accordingly. So if you want a navbar you would type in `ng g c navbar` and build that component out with html and css.

2. Have everything render on a single page so that once you have a website's skeleton completed it'll render declaratively and logically.

3. Make a route that brings you to a mock 404/error page using your router. Make sure the page is completely devoid of any other components!

4. Push everythong to GitHub.
