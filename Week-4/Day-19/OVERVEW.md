## Lab

### Our First Angular App! 

1. Create an angular app using `ng new <app-name>`
2. Open it up in VS Code and look at the project structure. Notice how components are grouped in their own folders. 
3. Try serving it by typing `ng serve --open`
4. In your project's root folder, make one new component using `ng generate component <component-name>` or `ng g c <component-name>` for short.
5. Delete everything in your app.component.html, and link your new component to it. 
6. Style the text in your component with the css file. 
7. Push your project to GitHub.
