## Lab

### Observable Practice

1. In your Angular project, I want you to create a new service and have that service create an observable from the internet. 
2. Find json data online that you want to use for your service and point your observable to that data. Think of the data as your backend.
3. In a seperate component, have your data logged to the console. 
4. Render your data to the DOM dynamically. 

## Homework

### Unit Testing

1. Create a node project and `npm install` a testing library.
2. Make sure that you update your package.json so that the test scripts points to your testing dependency. 
3. Create a simple test that checks for equality. 
4. Push it to GitHub.

>“All of a sudden, we’ve lost a lot of control,’ he said. ‘We can’t turn off our internet; we can’t turn off our smartphones; we can’t turn off our computers. You used to ask a smart person a question. Now, who do you ask? It starts with g-o, and it’s not God…” - Steve Wozniak
