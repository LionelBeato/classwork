## Lab

### Explore JavaScript Libraries

1. Using npm, install a javascript library. 
2. Implement the functionality of that library (so if I had lodash I would call a lodash method, if I had momentJS I would use it to formate a date, etc)
3. Try to use more than one library! 


### Create a simple todo app using express

1. Using express, create a backend for a simple todo application. 
2. Make sure you have full **CRUD** functionality. 
3. Create a simple frontend for your app.


## Homework

### Testing out Vue

1. Create a vue application.
2. Using a template literal, have that vue application render your name.
3. Using *v-for* have vue output a list of items of whatever you like. 
4. Push your application to GitHub!
