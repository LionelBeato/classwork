## Lab

### Explore JavaScript Libraries

1. Using npm, install a javascript library (lodash, moment, chart.js, etc). 
2. Implement the functionality of that library (so if I had lodash I would call a lodash method, if I had momentJS I would use it to formate a date, etc)
3. Try to use more than one library! 
4. Push your project to GitHub. 

## Homework

### Testing out Vue

1. Create a vue application.
2. Using a template literal, have that vue application render your name.
3. Using *v-for* have vue output a list of items of whatever you like. 
4. Push your application to GitHub! 

### TypeScript Project

1. Using `tsc` to compile a .ts file, create a typescript project. Be sure to have an index.html, style.css, etc. Remember to link the .js and not the .ts in your html! 

2. Declare at least two strongly typed variables. And have them render something to the page. 

3. Push your project to GitHub!
