## Lab

### Playing around with grids

1. Create an html file with a css framework linked.
2. In your file, make a grid with at least 8 columns and three rows.
3. Have one column take up half the available space available.
4. Have another column take up a third of the space available.  

## Homework

### Model View Controller practice

1. Create an express app using node with a server.js.
2. Using `modules.export`, create and export a model.js with a class defining your model. Think of it as an object. 
3. Import that model into your server.js and construct a new object.
4. Create an index.html and in the head, have code that will fetch and render your object to the DOM. 
5. Push it to GitHub!
