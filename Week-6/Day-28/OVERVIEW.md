## Lab

### Implement a Binary Tree

1. In a Java Project, create two classes: a BinaryTree class an a Node class. 
2. In your node class, add the appropiate variables and a constructor. 
3. In your BinaryTree class write out a method to add a node recursively and another to implement that method. 
4. Have a main where you can construct your BinaryTree, but sure to add elements to your tree. 
5. Override tostring in both your classes and see what it looks like when you print out your tree. 
6. Implement a search method for your binary tree. 


## Homework

### Refining our Spring Boot Application 

1. Have your frontends set up for full CRUD implementation. 
2. In your javascript, write a method for deleting an item.
3. Write a method for updating an item.
4. Wrte a method for adding an item.
