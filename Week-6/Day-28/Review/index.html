<!-- html stands for hypertext markup language-->
<!-- though it may be refered as such, html is not a proper programming language-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- the html tag dictates the start of your html webpage-->
<html lang="en">
    <!--Each page should have a "head." Heads are tags that contain metadata for the page-->
    <!-- It is also where we would link major javascript and css files-->

    <!-- In HTML you use what we call tags to declaratively add content to your page-->
    <!-- Tags can take many forms and can come in many varieties-->
    <!-- When we call a tag on a page, we're creating whats called an element-->
    <!-- Elements can also be refered to as nodes-->
    <!-- The heading tag can go from biggest (h1) to smallest (h6)-->
    <h1>This is a header.</h1>
    <h3>This is a smaller header.</h3>


    <!-- Probably the most used tag and a basic building block of a page woul be the div tag-->
    <!-- You can say that div stands for division-->

    <!-- By default, divs are considered block elements-->
    <!-- Block elements will occupy an entire width's length of a webpage-->
    <div>
        <h1>
            This header is inside a div!
        </h1>
    </div>

    <!-- Certain tags, like span are inline elements which means they will share the row with other elements-->
    <div>
        <p>
            <!-- span is commonly used to target elements inside of a block level element-->
            This is my paragraph! <span>This is a span in my paragraph!</span>
        </p>
    </div>

    <!--Nowadays, the use of semantic elements are highly encouraged-->
    <!-- Below are a few examples: -->
    <section></section>
    <aside></aside>
    <nav></nav>
    <footer></footer>
    <article></article>
    <header></header>
    <!-- any element that clearly defines its function or purpose can be considered semantic-->

    <!-- CSS -->
    <!-- all elements can have a property that is refered to as an attribute-->
    <!-- two major attributes are id= and class=-->
    <!-- these will refer to CSS values-->
    <div>
        <p class="myClass">
            This is a custom paragraph. 
        </p>
    </div>
