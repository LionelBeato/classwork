/* This is how you write a comment in CSS */
/* CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet */
/* In here we can declare "classes" and "ids" */
/* Classes can be shared among elements, ids are unique to just one */

/* Here is how you would declare a class, note the dot notation */
/* The class is what we refer to as a selector */
.myClass{
    /* Within our selectors we have declarations */
    /* declarations contain a property and a value for that property */
    color:red; 
    /* One selector can have many declarations */
    font-size: 3rem;
}
/* Below is how you'd call an Id, note the pound notation */
#myId{

/* You can also target tags themselves */
div{

}

/* Additionally, you can target with specification such as all p tags within divs */
div > p {

}

/* You can also select multiple selectors using commas  */
/* Note that it's bad practice to leave selections blank */
/* If you have blank selections, you might want to delete it */
