<!-- ### Midterm Exam

- Using the link provided to you in your email, complete the google form exam.
- The exam will be split into three sections covering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- You may use your editor to troubleshoot and test code, but you may not look online to reference answers. 
- You may use your notes.
- We will review the exam together afterwards.  -->

### Fibonacci Sequence

1. In your Project, create a method that prints out the Fibonacci numbers. 
2. Note that you would need to use recursion in order to accomplish this. 
3. Each number in the sequence is the sum of the two numbers that precede it. So the sequence goes: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 and so on...

## Homework

### Finishing touches on Spring App and Deployment

1. Using Gradle, create a jar file for your application.
