## Lab

### Big O Assigment

Consider the following algorithms for determining whether anyone in the room has the same birthday as you. 

*algorithm 1* : You say your birthday, and ask whether anyone in the room has the same birthday. If they do, they yes. 

You can describe this as constant or *0(1)*. 

*algorithm 2* : you tell the first person your birthday and ask them if its the same; if they say no, you tell the second person and so on, etc... 

You can describe this as linear or *0(n)*.

*algorithm 3* : you only ask the first person; then the first person will ask the second person the same questions, and if the answer is no, the second person will ask the third and so on, etc... 

You can describe this a quadratic or *O(n^2)*.

## Homework

1. Integrate the update method for the donuts api.
2. Have everything styled and looking nice!
