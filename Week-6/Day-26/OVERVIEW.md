## Lab

### Simple List Practice 

1. Create an ArrayList of at least 10 elements
2. Use an enhanced for loop to iterate through that list and print out each value.
3. Write control flow that checks to see if a specific element is inside the array and print out a statement acknowledging that value (so if you're favorite animal is in an animal list, print out "That's my favorite animal!").
4. Create a simple hashmap with 5 different elements. 
5. Create a LinkedList with 5 different elements.
6. In your LinkedList, set a new value to the middle element. 

## Homework

### Create a Spring App for the week

1. Create a Spring App for this week! Try to use just one model for now.
2. Set up your front end using thymeleaf if you'd like. 
3. Remember to use a Service for your Controller.
