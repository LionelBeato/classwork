## Lab

### Implement Stacks and Queues

1. In a Java project, create a stack of at least 5 items. Note where the elements are placed in the stack. 
2. Remove two elements from the stack. 
3. Print the current top of the stack to the console. 
4. Next create a queue with at least 5 elements. Note where the elements are placed in the queue.
5. Remove two elements from the queue. 


### JUNIT practice

1. In your Project, create a couple of methods that return different types of values. Have one method throw an exception. 
2. Generate tests for those values using something like `assertEquals()`. 
3. Generate a test for the exception that uses `assertThrows()`.

## Homework

### Refine your Spring Apps

1. Add a frontend to your spring app using thymeleaf or whatever you feel like utilizing. 
2. In your frontend, have it designed so that you can easily add, remove, and update items in your database. 
3. Implement the HTTP methods corresponding with our CRUD methods.
