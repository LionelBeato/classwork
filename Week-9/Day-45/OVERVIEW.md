## Lab

### Work on your frontend Mutation

1. Keep working on your frontend mutation. 
2. Once that's done, feel free to continue refining and optimizing the styling for your frontend. 

## Homework

### Deployment!

1. While we can deploy our applications just fine, we would need to do some considerable tinkering with it. I will opt to end our app development here considering the following:

    - Our SQL databases would need to be hosted. 
    - Our Backends would also need to be hosted (though we've practiced this!).
    - Finally, our frontend configurations need to be properly set for hosting. 

2. You can attempt to deploy via netlify, though it wont work. A link is provided in your frontend's README. Take note that you would have to make a new account and the link will request to make a new repo. If you want to try netflify, navigate to `app.netlify.com` and make a new account there. You can then grant access to your repos and target any repo for deployment. 

3. Next week we will create an online database solution using a cloud platform (most likely firebase). Be prepared by making a firebase account at `firebase.google.com `.  We will use *serverless functions* along with a noSQL cloud implementation.
