## Lab


### Gatsby Frontend

1. Using my code as a reference, hookup your gatsby frontend to your Java backend. 
2. Be sure to start by editing your `gatsby-config` file.
3. After that, make a page query in whatever page you want to render your data. 
4. You can test your query by going to the graphiql GUI of your app. 
5. Once things are hooked up, continue working on your frontend's styling and properties. We'll attempt to deploy what we have tomorrow!
