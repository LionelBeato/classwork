## Lab

### Create a Project Board for your Gatsby Frontend

1. Let's keep using GitHub tools to help us further iterate our projects. On your repo, click "Projects". 
2. Now, click on "new Project." It will prompt you for a template; select the "basic kanban." 
3. Finally, create any notes/issues you want to track. This board will help you organize any ideas you may have is a good indicator of development milestones.
