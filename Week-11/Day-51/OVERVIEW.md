### Frontend Practice

1. I know it's been a while since we've practice our front end fundamentals. So lets go ahead and do just that! Make a new folder and in that folder create your `index.html`, `script.js`, and `style.css`.

2. Link your `script.js` and `style.css` to your `index.html`. If you want, you can use a front end framework for style. 

3. Add the essential elements of a page to your `index.html` (footer, navbar, main, etc). 

4. (Optional but highly encouraged) Practice writing react code and try to create another webpage using react. Use `npx create-react-app` for rapid development.
